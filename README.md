# Traffic Signals (Java AWT)

A simple **traffic light simulation** using Java AWT with multithreading and event handling.

## Features
- Simulates traffic lights (red, yellow, green).  
- Modes: **Normal**, **Left**, **Right** (via menu).  
- Automatic signal changes with threads.

## Use Case
- Suppose you have a dataset where the right side has much traffic, so you can adjust the time duration of the light.
- In this case, the right road has a longer duration of green light.

## Run
```bash
javac Trafic.java
java Trafic
